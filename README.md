# Everest

A resource-oriented HTTP client for .net. This is an asynchronous fork of the synchronous Everest client.

### Install

via [NuGet](http://nuget.org):

    PM> Install-Package Everest-async

### Usage

    var client = new Everest.RestClient();
    
    // GET http://www.google.com
    var homePage = await client.Get("http://www.google.com");
    
    // GET http://www.google.com/search?q=everest+http+client
    var searchResults = await homePage.Get("search?q=everest+http+client");
    
    ...

#### Resource-Oriented?

To use Everest, create a [RestClient](Everest/RestClient.cs):

    var client = new Everest.RestClient();

A [RestClient](Everest/RestClient.cs) is a [Resource](Everest/Resource.cs), therefore it can be used to make requests, such as "Get" requests:

    var homePage = await client.Get("http://www.google.com");

The response (homePage) is a [Response](Everest/Response.cs), which itself is also a [Resource](Everest/Resource.cs), so we can call "Get" on that too, to get a new Response, relative to the URI that responded to the first request:

    // GET http://www.google.com/search?q=everest+http+client
    var searchResults = await homePage.Get("search?q=everest+http+client");

All requests return Responses, so we can do this over and over.

#### Resource API

Everest requests are ultimately dispatched by calling the "Send" method on a [Resource](Everest/Resource.cs), to get a [Response](Everest/Response.cs):

    namespace Everest
    {
        public interface Resource
        {
            ...
            Task<Response> Send(HttpMethod method, string uri, BodyContent body, params PipelineOption[] overridingPipelineOptions)
            ...
        }
    }

Most of the time, you have a particular verb in mind when you make an HTTP request, so you'll want the convenient [Resource API extension methods](Everest/ResourceApi.cs):

    namespace Everest
    {
        public static class ResourceApi
        {
            ...
            public static Task<Response> Get(this Resource resource, string uri, params PipelineOption[] pipelineOptions)
            {
                return resource.Send(HttpMethod.Get, uri, null, pipelineOptions);
            }
            ...
        }
    }

#### Asynchronous programming

This fork is designed to be solely asynchronous and requires .NET Framework 4.5. There are intentionally no options for making synchronous calls. Although you can call Result on any Task<Response> to make the request synchronously, you are strongly encourage to propagate async programming up to the top level of your code.

#### Pipelines

When you make HTTP requests, you often need to set specific parameters (such as request headers), or handle responses in a particular way. For anything beyond the request URI and body, Everest allows the request and/or response handling to be tweaked, using [pipeline options](Everest/Pipeline/PipelineOption.cs):

    using Everest;
    using Everest.Headers;
    
    ...
    
    var client = new RestClient(new RequestHeader("X-Requested-With", "Everest"));

[RequestHeader](Everest/Headers/RequestHeader.cs) is one example of a [PipelineOption](Everest/Pipeline/PipelineOption.cs), which are used to customise the way Everest handles requests and responses.

#### Pipeline Options

[PipelineOption](Everest/Pipeline/PipelineOption.cs) is a [marker interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_interface_pattern) implemented by anything that can customise a request or its response handling.

Pipeline options can be applied to _all_ requests by passing them to the RestClient constructor:
    
    var options = new PipelineOption[] { ExpectStatus.OK, new RequestHeader("foo", "bar") }
    
    new RestClient(options);

...or applied to a single request at a time (often _overriding_ existing options):

    new RestClient().Get(url, new RequestHeader("foo", "baz"))

The following pipeline options can be used to customise request/response behaviour:

* [BasicAuth](Everest/Auth/BasicAuth.cs) sets the '[Authorization](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.8)' header for [HTTP Basic authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
    
* [IfModifiedSince](Everest/Caching/IfModifiedSince.cs) sets the '[If-Modified-Since](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.25)' HTTP header
    
* [Accept](Everest/Headers/Accept.cs) sets the '[Accept](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.1)' HTTP header
    
* [SetRequestHeaders](Everest/Headers/SetRequestHeaders.cs) sets arbitrary HTTP request headers.
    
* [ExpectResponseHeaders](Everest/Headers/ExpectResponseHeaders.cs) throws exceptions when unexpected header values are present.
    
* [ExpectStatus](Everest/Status/ExpectStatus.cs) throws exceptions when the response status code is unexpected.
    
* [ExpectStatusInRange](Everest/Status/ExpectStatusInRange.cs) throws exceptions when the response status code is outside a range of values.
    
* [ExpectStatusNotInRange](Everest/Status/ExpectStatusNotInRange.cs) throws exceptions when the response status code is inside a range of values.

#### Body Content

An implementation of [BodyContent](Everest/Content/BodyContent) can be passed into any request that takes a payload (e.g. POST/PUT):

    namespace Everest.Content
    {
        public interface BodyContent
        {
            Stream AsStream();
            string MediaType { get; }
        }
    }

A couple of implementations of BodyContent should come in handy:

* Use [StringBodyContent](Everest/Content/StringBodyContent.cs) to send plain old text/plain
    
* [StreamBodyContent](Everest/Content/StreamBodyContent.cs) for stuff that can be streamed

* [JsonBodyContent](Everest/Content/JsonBodyContent.cs) for a JSON request body

#### Status Codes

By default, Everest throws an exception if the response status code is in the range 400-599.

You can override the acceptable response status code:
    
    // Create a client that doesn't usually complain about errors
    client = new RestClient(ExpectStatus.IgnoreStatus)
    
    // GET request, expecting a 404
    client.Get("foo", ExpectStatus.NotFound)

    // POST request, expecting a 201
    client.Post("foo", "body", new ExpectStatus(HttpStatusCode.Created))

#### Redirection

By default, Everest will automatically follow redirects. Change that behaviour with the [AutoRedirect](Everest/Redirection/AutoRedirect.cs) option:

    client.Post("/foos", "body", AutoRedirect.DoNotAutoRedirect)

For security, Authorization headers are not sent in requests following automatic redirects. This can be overridden:

    client.Put("/foos/1", "body", AutoRedirect.AutoRedirectAndForwardAuthorizationHeader)

#### Builder API

Given a resource, Resource.With(params PipelineOption[] options) returns a new client with overridden default options:

    var client = new RestClient("http://www.example.com");
    var authenticatedAjaxClient = client.With(new BasicAuth("user", "pass"))
                                        .With(new RequestHeader("X-Requested-With", "ajax"));

#### Everest make conservatories in the UK

I know, sorry. I work with a guy called [Julian Everett](http://julianeverett.wordpress.com), who is an expert in the art of [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). This project is named (nearly) after him.
